## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
This is an updated KBC-style quiz script, built in April 2025, using Python lists to manage questions and prize levels. Itâ€™s part of my journey to master algorithmic challenges, evolving from a simpler quiz to this list-based version.

## Why I Built This
- To practice working with Python lists for data storage.
- To create an interactive multi-level quiz with escalating rewards.
- To enhance my skills in loops, input validation, and basic logic.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Presents 7 questions (currently all the same: "Which City is known as capital of INDIA?") with 4 options.
- Offers prize levels from Rs.1000 to Rs.200,000, updating money at specific milestones.
- Ends the game on incorrect answers, invalid inputs, or out-of-range selections.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- How to use lists to organize questions, options, and answers.
- Implementing `for` loops to iterate through quiz levels.
- Basic error handling with `try-except` for input validation.

---

## ðŸ”„ Updates
- âœ… Introduced a list-based structure for questions and prizes.
- âœ… Added a prize system with levels (Rs.1000 to Rs.200,000).

---

## Known Issues
- All questions are identical ("Which City...?" with "New_Delhi" as answer) because i want to show the understanding of code

## Author
- [Sid.py] ([https://github.com/BscCanCode](https://github.com/BscCanCode))
## Development Notes
- Uses pure Python with no external libraries.

## NOTE
- README crafted with assistance from an AI chatbot.
- Kept raw to document my learning processâ€”planning to refine later.
